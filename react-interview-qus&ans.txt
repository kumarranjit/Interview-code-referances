React Interview:
===================
1. What is react why use react ?
2. What is state? Local mutable date managed inside a component.
3. What is props?
4. Difference between function vs class component?
5. What is hook? Let you reuse stateful logic inside functional components.
6. What is HOC? = A function that takes a component as input and returns an enhanced component 
Redux
=====
What is redux? How to use
Q1. What is DOM?
   The DOM(Document Object Model) represents the web page as a tree-like structure which allows JavaScript to dynamically access 
   and manipulate the content and structure of a web page.

Q2. What is React?
   1. React is an open source Javascript Library.
   2. React is used for building user interfaces(UI).
   3. React simplifies the creation of SPA by using reusable components.

Q4. What is SPA(Single Page Application)?
   A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that have only one single web page Whenever user do some action on the website 
   then in response content dynamically updated without refreshing or loading new page

Q5. What is the difference between React and Angular? 
   React and Angular both are used to create single page Ul applications using components.
   1. React is a JavaScript library |  Angular is a complete framework.
   2. React uses a virtual DOM which makes it faster. | Angular uses a real DOM
   3. React is smaller in size and lightweight therefore faster sometime | Angular is bigger because it is a complete framework
   4. React depends on external libraries for many complex features, so developer has to write many lines of code for complex functionality 
      Since Angular is a complete framework therefore it provide built in support for future routing, form, validation and HTTP requests

Q6. What is the difference between DOM and Virtual DOM?
   React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the Ul without re-render the entire page, 
   which helps improve performance and make the application more responsive.

Q7. What is component?
   A component is a reusable building block of an application that encapsulates specific UI elements and related business logic.
   It helps in organizing the application into smaller, independent, 
   and maintainable pieces that can be reused across different parts of the application. 

Q8. What is the role of index.js file, ReactDOM and render method in React?
   ReactDOM is a JavaScript library which convert your components (which are written in React syntax) to the actual browser DOM.
   Index.js file is the JavaScript file which renders all the component and replace the root element of index.html file with the newly created root element. 

Q8. How Does a React App Load and Render Components?
   Step1.  Browser Loads HTML File
   When a user opens a React application, the browser first loads a minimal index.html file.
   * This file contains a root element:
      <div id="root"></div>
   * Initially, this page is almost empty.

   Step2.  JavaScript Bundle is Loaded
   The browser then loads the compiled JavaScript files (bundle) generated by tools like Webpack / Vite.
   * These bundles contain:
   o React library
   o Application code
   o All components

   Step 3.  React Attaches to the Root Element
   In index.js / main.jsx, React attaches itself to the DOM:
   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   root.render(<App />);
   * React now controls the content inside the #root element.

Q9. Can browser read a JSX File? What is Babel?
   Babel in React is used to transpile JSX syntax into regular JavaScript which browser can understand.

Q10. What is the role of fragment in React?
   In React, a fragment is a way to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. 
   Ex. 

Q11. What is Prop Drilling in React? Why to avoid  Prop Drilling? What are the ways to avoid the Prop drilling?
   Prop drilling is the process of passing down Props through multiple layers of components 

   Why to avoid => 1. Harder to maintain 
            2.  Increase the code complexity
      3. Debugging becomes challenging 
   Way to avoid => 1. Using Context API 
      2. Using Redux 
      3. Using component composition 
      4. Using Custom hook
