JSX – HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
Components – Reusable UI building blocks it has own business logic
Props – Read-only data passed to components
State – Mutable data managed inside a component

1. Functional Components & Hooks (Most Important)

Common Hooks:

| Hook          | Purpose                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Local state                       |
| `useEffect`   | Side effects (API, subscriptions) |
| `useContext`  | Global state                      |
| `useRef`      | DOM reference / mutable value     |
| `useMemo`     | Memoize expensive calculation     | useMemo → optimize values
| `useCallback` | Memoize functions                 | useCallback → optimize functions
| `useReducer ` |                                   | 

customee Hooks- what?, why?, how? Examples

2. Higher order component(HOC) what? Why? when? How?

3. Life cycle methods of component (for class component)

4. Component Design & Reusability
    Best Practices:
    Small, focused components
    Presentational vs Container components
    Reusable UI with props + composition
    Controlled vs uncontrolled components

4. State Management (State / Props, Prop drilling, context)
    Sub Topics : 
    Local State → useState
    Global State → Context API -> Prefer Context API for medium apps
    Large Apps → Redux / Zustand -> Use Redux only when state becomes complex

5. Redux / Zustand -> Why?, How?, When?

6. Routing
    React Routing
    Pynamic Routing
    Protected Routing (RBAC & ABAC)
    Query param

7. Forms & Validation
    Controlled components
    Validation using Formik / React Hook Form
    Custom validation logic

8. API Calls
    Fetch
    Axios

9. Performance Optimization (Senior-Level Topic)
    Techniques:
    React.memo
    useMemo, useCallback
    Avoid unnecessary re-renders
    Asset optimization
    Write optimization
    Bunduler
    Rendering component faster
    
    Lazy loading (React.lazy)
        Code splitting
        Suspense
        reduce code junking 

10. Virtual DOM
    Reconcilation
    React fiber
    Render component -> how render work
    Differ algorithm

11. SSR Vs CSR -> difference, what?

12. Async Task
    Events
    Promises

13. Testing & Quality -> unit testing -(VITest, Jest)
    
    Vitest -> is a modern, fast testing framework that integrates seamlessly with React applications 
            built using Vite
        Key Notes: 
        React Testing Library (RTL)
        jsdom (or happy-dom)
        @testing-library/jest-dom
    Jest
    Component unit testing
    Snapshot testing
    Reusability / modularity / testability / readabiity

14. Stylying 
    Tailwind CSS Vs Bootstrap 

15. Advanced Topics (Interview + Real Projects)
    Micro Frontends
    Web Components integration (Stencil + React)
    Mono repo
    Nx
    Security (XSS, CSRF)
