Here are Angular latest interview questions (2024–2025), grouped by beginner → advanced,  Manipulates DOM structure or behavior
with a strong focus on real-world and senior-level expectations. 
This will be especially useful for you as a Senior Front-End Developer (Angular + React).
===============================================================================================================

🔹 Angular Core & Basics

1. What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?
2. What are the main features introduced in the latest Angular versions?
    2.1. Signals (🔥 Most Important)
    2.2 Standalone Components (No NgModule)
    2.3. Modern Control Flow (@if, @for, @switch)
    2.4. Deferred Loading (@defer) => Loads parts of the UI only when needed (on scroll, idle, interaction).
    2.5. Zoneless Change Detection (Advanced) => Angular can now work without zone.js, relying on signals and explicit triggers.
      Why?
      Better performance
      Predictable updates
      Smaller bundle size

    2.6. Improved SSR & Hydration => Hydration reuses server-rendered DOM on the client instead of destroying and re-rendering it.
    2.7. ESBuild & Faster Builds => esbuild is an extremely fast, modern JavaScript bundler and minifier for web development
     Angular replaced Webpack with ESBuild internally.
    2.8. Improved Router (Standalone + Lazy)
        True component-level lazy loading
        No modules needed

3. What is standalone components in Angular?
  A component that does not require NgModule and can be used directly.
  Why?
  Less boilerplate
  Easier to maintain
  Faster onboarding
  Standalone components are now the recommended default for new Angular apps.

4. In Angular, component communication depends on hierarchy.
  Parent to child uses @Input, child to parent uses @Output.
  For sibling or unrelated components, we use a shared service with RxJS Subject/BehaviorSubject.
  For large-scale apps, we use state management like NgRx.
  Angular 16+ also allows Signals for reactive communication.

5. What is the role of NgModule? Is it still required?
  NgModule was traditionally used to organize and bootstrap Angular applications, 
  but with the introduction of standalone components, it is no longer required for new apps. 
  Angular now recommends a component-first architecture, while NgModule remains supported for legacy and migration use cases.

6. What is signals in Angular?
  Signal is a reactive state container that store a value and automatically notify consumer when the state value
  changes,   
  Why signals?
  Better performance
  Less boilerplate than RxJS for UI state
  Predictable change detection
  Signals reduce unnecessary change detection and are ideal for local UI state.

  What is computes and effect in Angular signals?
  computes() creates a derived signal that automatically updates when its dependencies change.
    returns a new signal whose value is computed based on other signals. 
    It re-evaluates whenever any of its dependencies change.
    readonly signal Ex: fullName = computed(() => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`);
    
  effect() runs a side effect whenever the signals it depends on change.
    It is used for performing actions in response to signal changes, 
    such as updating the DOM or making API calls.
    Ex: effect(() => console.log(`Full name is: ${fullName()}`));

7. Difference between Component and Directive?
  A Component is a directive with a template.
  It controls a view (UI) and is used to build screens and layouts.
✅ Key Points
    Always has an HTML template
    Used to create reusable UI blocks
    Defined using @Component
    Can have styles, lifecycle hooks, and business logic

  A Directive is used to change the behavior or appearance of an existing DOM element.It does not have its own template.
✅ Key Points
    No template
    Enhances or modifies existing elements
    Defined using @Directive
    Commonly used for DOM manipulation

7. What is directive? Types of directives in Angular? =>
  Angular directives are of three types:
   1.Component Directive => A component is actually a special type of directive with a template.
   2.Structural Directives => change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.(ex: *ngIf, *ngFor,*ngSwitch, ngTemplate)
   3.Attribute Directives => change the appearance or behavior of an existing element.(ngClass, ngStyle)
   4.last Custom directive 

  What is a Custom Structural Directive? => changes the DOM structure by adding or removing elements.
      Angular provides:
        TemplateRef → represents the template
        ViewContainerRef → controls where the template is rendered
        
  Is Directive support Lifecycle Hooks?
      Yes,Directives support the same lifecycle hooks as components (except template-related ones).
      ✅ Common Directive Lifecycle Hooks
        ngOnInit ->Runs once after directive initialization
        ngOnChanges -> Runs when @Input() values change
        ngDoCheck -> Custom change detection logic
        ngOnDestroy -> Cleanup (unsubscribe, remove listeners)

      ⚠️ Hooks NOT Available (These depend on templates, which directives don’t have)
        ngAfterViewInit
        ngAfterContentInit

  Directive vs Pipe => Pipe is Transforms data in templates, lot of build in pipes available in angular, even can create custome pipe as well

8. What is dependency injection (DI) in Angular?
Dependency Injection in Angular is a design pattern where services are provided by Angular’s injector instead of being created manually, 
promoting loose coupling, reusability, and testability.
